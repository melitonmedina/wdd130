                <p>
                    I grew up in one of Peru’s coastal cities, where I enjoyed not only the warmth of the weather but also that of family and friends. Playing soccer is one of my favorite things to do, which is something I would do almost every afternoon after school during my early teenage years. Summer begins in December and ends in late March. It is during these summer months that “Carnaval” takes place, and the fair also happens around this time. Also, when it comes to its cuisine, there is a very good number of people from different parts of the globe that fall in love with it. I have always been highly interested in technology, and my current job allows me to interact with it. Currently, I am seeking a software engineering degree; this engineering field would provide a valuable skill set in programming and web development.
