                I grew up in one of Peru's coastal cities, where I enjoyed not only the warmth of the weather but that of family and friends. Playing soccer is one of my favorite things to do, which is something I would do almost every afternnon after school during my early teenage years. I have always been highly intersted in technolgy, and my current job allows me to interact with it.
